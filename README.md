## Coding Standards

We follow all coding standards as specified by WordPress. To enforce these standards we use the industry standard code linters.

### PHP

For PHP we use the PHP Code Sniffer in combination with the WPCS configuration, as provided by WordPress. You can find the config in phpcs.xml.

### Editor

We also provide an editor config, found in the file .editorconfig. It specifies tabs instead of spaces, and ensures linebreak consistency between operating systems.
